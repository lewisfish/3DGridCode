# 3DGridCode
3D Grid code used in PH5023 Monte Carlo Radiation Transport (MCRT) techniques @ St Andrews University

## How to run

### Using Make

First Download the code from this [link](https://github.com/lewisfish/3DGridCode/archive/refs/tags/v1.1.1.zip)

Then open a terminal and change directories to the codes location and unzip it.

Then type ```make``` into your terminal to compile the code.

Then type ```./mcgrid``` to run the code.

### Using FPM

First Download the code from this [link](https://github.com/lewisfish/3DGridCode/archive/refs/tags/v1.1.1.zip)

Then open a terminal and change directories to the codes location and unzip it.

Then type ```fpm run --profile release``` to compile and run the code.

Details on installing FPM on your platform can be found [here](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/install/index.html#install).

## Documentation

Documentation of the API can be found [here](http://lewismcmillan.com/3DGridCode/).

Explanation of the code and the MCRT method can be found [here](http://www-star.st-and.ac.uk/~kw25/teaching/mcrt/mcrt.html).

## Make & GFortran 

Check version, or whether installed, by opening terminal and typing ```make --version``` and ```gfortran --version```

### Make

Mac: Install the xcode developer tools, found [here](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). If make is still not installed, open terminal and type ```xcode-select - - install```. 

Linux (Debian): Open a terminal and install by typing ```sudo apt-get install build-essential```. 

### GFortran 
 
Mac: [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) offers an easy install via ```brew install gcc```. The binaries can be installed directly from the [gfortran maintainers](https://github.com/fxcoudert/gfortran-for-macOS/releases), and additional info can be found [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries#MacOS).

Linux (Debian): Open a terminal and install by typing ```sudo apt install gfortran```.

More details on GFortran may be found [here](https://fortran-lang.org/learn/os_setup/install_gfortran/).
